# Custom AI Agent Prompts

This directory stores custom prompts for AI agents that are useful for specific tasks but don't fit into the categories of skills or built-in commands.

## Purpose

Prompts in this directory are intended for:

- **Task-specific guidance** - Specialized instructions for handling particular types of work or problems
- **Domain-specific context** - Prompts that provide expertise in specific domains or industries
- **Workflow optimization** - Prompts that help agents follow particular processes or methodologies
- **Ad-hoc solutions** - Useful prompt patterns for tasks that don't warrant creating full skills or commands

## How This Differs From Skills and Commands

- **Skills** - Reusable, well-defined capabilities that agents can call upon
- **Commands** - Built-in operations that are integrated into agent workflows
- **Prompts** - Flexible, task-specific guidance that can be applied to various scenarios

## Organization

Organize prompts by their primary use case or domain. Examples:

- `code-review-guidelines.md` - Prompts for conducting code reviews
- `documentation-standards.md` - Prompts for writing documentation
- `security-best-practices.md` - Prompts for security considerations
- `testing-strategies.md` - Prompts for test planning and execution

## Usage

Load a prompt from this directory when you need specialized guidance for a particular task. Provide the relevant prompt as context to the AI agent to enhance the interaction with domain expertise and structured thinking.

## Guidelines

When adding prompts to this directory:

- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Include context about when and how to use the prompt
- Keep prompts focused on a single task or domain
- Update this README if adding a significant new prompt category
